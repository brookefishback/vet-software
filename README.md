A local veterinarian has commissioned you to write them a new check-in/check-out system to track the status of their furry patients
The vet accepts two kinds of animals: Cats and Dogs
The vet has 5 rooms for patients to be seen
Each pet has one owner; owner has a name and phone number
The program books a room for each patient checking in and tracks who is in what room
If no rooms are available, no room will be booked for a patient
Patients can check out, freeing up a room
A menu manages Checkout, Check In, Room status
Pet name and type should be optional, and the class should expect all or some of the attributes when the object is created (Consider collecting info into variables and making the object AFTER all info has been collected)
